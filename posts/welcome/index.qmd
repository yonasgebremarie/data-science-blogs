Welcome! This blog is a space where I share my thoughts and learning as I explore data science, artificial intelligence, and how these technologies interact with people in the real world.

I am particularly interested in responsible use of AI. Through this blog, I will reflect on research findings, course projects, and ideas that challenge common assumptions about technology and decision-making.

This blog is also part of my journey as a student in data science, where clear communication is just as important as technical skill. My goal is to explain complex ideas in a way that is thoughtful, accessible, and grounded in evidence.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you find something here that makes you think a little differently about data and AI.
