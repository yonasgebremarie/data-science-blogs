Hi, I’m Yonas. I’m a data science student with a background in mathematics and a strong interest in artificial intelligence and how people interact with data-driven systems.

This blog is a space where I explore ideas at the intersection of data science, AI, and human decision-making. I’m particularly interested in understanding when AI helps people, when it does not, and how thoughtful design can improve collaboration between humans and intelligent systems.

Here, I share reflections on research, coursework, and topics that challenge common assumptions about technology, with a focus on clear and accessible communication.
